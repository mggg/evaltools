    ) -> Axes:
    """
    Plot a violin plot, which takes `scores` â€” a list of lists, where each sublist
    will be its own violin. Proposed scores will be plotted as colored circles on
    their respective violin. Color the violins conditioned on the kind of the scores
    (ensemble or citizen), and if plotting ensemble, then trim each sublist to
    only the values between the 1-99th percentile, to match our boxplits
    (otherwise don't trim).

    Args:
        ax (Axes): `Axes` object on which the histogram is plotted.
        scores (dict): Dictionary with keys of `ensemble`, `citizen`, `proposed`
            which map to lists of numerical scores.
        proposed_info (dict, optional): Dictionary with keys of `colors`, `names`;
            the \(i\)th color in `color` corresponds to the \(i\)th name in `names.
        percentiles (tuple, optional): Observations outside this range of
            percentiles are ignored. Defaults to `(1, 99)`, such that observations
            between the 1st and 99th percentiles (inclusive) are included, and
            all others are ignored.
        rotation (float, optional): Tick labels are rotated `rotation` degrees
            _counterclockwise_.
        ticksize (float, optional): Font size for tick labels.
        jitter (float, optional): When there is more than one proposed plan,
            adjust its detail points by a value drawn from \(\mathcal U (-\epsilon,
            \epsilon)\) where \(\epsilon = \) `jitter`.

    Returns:
        `Axes` object on which the violins are plotted.
